#Recall that we can create variables with the following syntax:
num = 3

#  What is the data currently contained within "num"?

# What if i say:

num = num + 5

# What is in num now?

#if i say:
print(num)
#What do we expect to happen?

#How about with:
print(num/2)

#What will print out? What will num equal now?

#Do you understand why this happens?
