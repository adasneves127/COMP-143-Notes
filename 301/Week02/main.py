#Recall that we can create variables with the following syntax:
num = 3

#  What is the data currently contained within "num"?

# What if i say:

num = num + 5

# What is in num now?

#if i say:
print(num)
#What do we expect to happen?

#How about with:
print(num/2)

#What will print out? What will num equal now?

#Do you understand why this happens?



# Basic Data Types: String, Integer, Float, and Boolean

# String: A string is just text. It can be any length, and can contain 0-9, A-Z, a-z, any symbols, and some other special characters. It is denoted by: "string", 'string', or """string"""

# Integer: An integer is a whole number, either positive or negative. Examples include: 0, 10, -2, 102381, -1238912, etc.

# Float: A float is any number, either positive or negative, that has a decimal point. Examples include: 0.0, 10.0, -2.0, 102381.0, -1238912.0, PI, etc.

# Boolean: A Boolean is a logic value. It can only be True or False (There is no in-between state). For now, we will stick with defining it as True or False.
